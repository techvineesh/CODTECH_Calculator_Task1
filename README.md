## Colorful Calculator

This repository contains a Java Swing-based Colorful Calculator application. The calculator provides a graphical user interface for performing basic arithmetic operations.

### Features

- Input digits and perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- Support for decimal numbers and special functions like backspace and clear.
- Dynamically display input and calculation results in a text field.
- Colorful and visually appealing user interface with customizable buttons.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans) for running and editing Java code.

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/colorful-calculator.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.

3. Compile and run the `ColorfulCalculator.java` file to launch the Colorful Calculator application.

### Usage

- **Input**: Click the calculator buttons to input digits, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), decimal point (.), and special functions (Clear - "C", Backspace - "<-", Square Root - "âˆš", and Equals - "=").
- **Clear Input**: Click the "C" button to clear the current input and reset the display.
- **Backspace**: Click the "<-" button to remove the last character from the current input.
- **Calculate**: Click the "=" button to evaluate the arithmetic expression entered and display the result.

### Technical Details

- **Java Swing Components**: Utilizes `JFrame`, `JTextField`, `JButton`, and `JPanel` for building the graphical user interface.
- **Event Handling**: Implements `ActionListener` interface to handle button clicks and perform corresponding actions.
- **Arithmetic Expression Parsing**: Evaluates arithmetic expressions using a recursive descent parser to compute results.
